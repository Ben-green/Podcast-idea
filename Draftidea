Episode 1: A history of reality.

Intro â€“ Explain the structure of these initial 3 episodes making the below basic points
> These first 3 episodes are to outline an analytical frame work, which myself and my cohost Ben will then apply to various pieces of art that I have created, but also to other things taking place in the zietgiest.
> This first episode covers the history of the universe in brief and how it can be considered to be becoming more complex over time.
> The second episode covers a history of life on earth, and how this is tied up with a history of ideas and philosophy, touching in the thoughts of Karl Popper.
> The third episode covers a history of civilsation, focusing on the influence of capitalism, religion and empire. Finally the third episode looks at the creative industry and the dissemination of facts and ideas. Can art convey truth more easily than an academic paper or balance sheet? Is a newspaper headline or article a work of art, what about a song, even when it is used in an advert.
